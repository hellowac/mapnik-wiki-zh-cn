Mapnik is a Free Toolkit for developing mapping applications. It is written in modern C++ and has Python bindings that support fast-paced agile development. It can comfortably be used for both desktop map design and web development.

*Mapnik is about making beautiful maps*. It uses the AGG graphics library, which offers world-class anti-aliasing rendering with subpixel accuracy for geographic data.
