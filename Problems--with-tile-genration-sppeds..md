Sir, I am trying to render tiles for India bbox values(68.1,7.8,97.6,29.5). I am on it for 2 days. I am using generate_tiles.py to generate the tiles. And my estimation for number of tiles that would be generated for up-to 18 zoom levels is  30071160 at my PC con-fig I get a rate of nearly 3 tiles per second and by that maths the time needed to generate all tiles is in weeks. How do I optimize this generation:
MY PC COnfig:
2 G.B. Ram
500G.B. Hard Disk
Intel Dual core processor.
BY this estimation how long would it take to generate planet.osm.pbf tiles?
What P.C. config is recommended?
Please provide some data.
And are my estimations rite?
