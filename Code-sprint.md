## Why?

Coding, documentation and fun.  The previous Mapnik code sprint in September 2010 was both great fun and a great success.  Docs were written, Bugs were squashed, capabilities were added, performance was improved and new friends and colleagues were discovered.  [Proof](https://github.com/mapnik/mapnik/wiki/MapnikCodeSprint_MCS01_Results) 

This time, we'll tackle some more bugs, some of the lingering Top ten Cartography Wishes from last time, and perhaps knock out some awesome new Mapnik documentation for the ever-increasing user community.  

Last time, the *Top Ten* Advanced Cartography Wishes looked a bit like this: [Ideas](Ideas). Those that have been completed in the interim are struck-through.
