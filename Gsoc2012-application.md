## Why is your organization applying to participate in Google Summer of Code 2012? What do you hope to gain by participating?

We have participated for the past two years and its been both a fun time (we've had fantastic students) and powerful catalyst for open source collaboration. During the summer we have weekly development calls on skype and this has been a great benefit to the project.

## Did your organization participate in past Google Summer of Codes? If so, please summarize your involvement and the successes and challenges of your participation.

Yes, for two years. We've started slow, with two students the first year and three the next. Both years we have had students who have pushed the limits of their ability and the software tools - so the greatest challenge has been keeping up with them. But we've had great success integrating GSOC code during the winter months into the mainline codebase.


## If your organization has not previously participated in Google Summer of Code, have you applied in the past? If so, for what year(s)?

Not applicable

## Does your organization have an application template you would like to see students use? If so, please provide it now.

Explain how your project would benefit the the Mapnik community and what other projects might benefit directly or by example:

Please provide details of previous experience with C++:

Please provide a pull request solving a bug or other open issue on the Mapnik github site and provide the link here:

Please provide details of previous experience with the Antigrain Geometry Library, Boost, or graphics programming:

Please provide details of previous experience with mapping or GIS:

Please tell us why you are interested in your specific coding project:

Do you understand this is a serious commitment, equivalent to a full-time paid summer internship or summer job and that you will be communicating via email, blogging, and skype voice weekly with your mentor and project admin?
```

## What criteria did you use to select your mentors for this year's program? Please be as specific as possible.

They must be an active Mapnik community member and a core developer with a keen interest in working with students.

## What is your plan for dealing with disappearing students?

Maintain as constant as possible contact with them to catch early if they are likely to fade, and we make sure we have full contact information for them. This year we plan to only accept students who have provided patches and demonstrated a real actionable commitment to working on the project.

## What is your plan for dealing with disappearing mentors?

In past years we have successfully covered for mentors that need to travel or have other obligations. As admin (dane), I know them all well as this point so I feel good communication will help us work out potential difficulties.

## What steps will you take to encourage students to interact with your project's community before, during and after the program?

We would like them to introduce themselves by email to the users mailing list.

We would also like them to study the open tickets at https://github.com/mapnik/mapnik/issues and find one or more to provide a patch for.

## Are you a new organization who has a Googler or other organization to vouch for you? If so, please list their name(s) here.

We have participated for two previous years, hopefully this will be our third!
