# Project Ideas

Format should be:

## Packaging of Mapnik2
### Description:
This project can bring mapnik2 to use in a very easy way, just like apt-get install mapnik2 and it will be ready to use. This will include all the packaging work to add into linux distribution's main repository specially of Ubuntu's which is being used much more than other distributions and all the scripting work to install the mapnik2 by checking all the required dependencies and then also install them automatically and finally is the troubleshooting i.e if mapnik fails to install in any way then to do troubleshooting by itself to install it on user's machine.
### How it would benefit Mapnik Project
It will make mapnik to use very easily just like other software available to use and definitely will increase the usability of Mapnk  
### What student would learn
Packaging, Shell Scripting and Understanding of Mapnik's code and its complete use.
